**RareBench** is a pioneering benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of LLMs on 4 critical dimensions within the realm of rare diseases.
Meanwhile, we have compiled the largest open-source dataset on rare disease patients, establishing a benchmark for future studies in this domain. To facilitate differential diagnosis of rare diseases, we develop a dynamic few-shot prompt methodology, leveraging a comprehensive rare disease knowledge graph synthesized from multiple knowledge bases, significantly enhancing LLMs‚Äô diagnos-
tic performance. Moreover, we present an exhaustive comparative study of GPT-4‚Äôs diagnostic capabilities against those of specialist physicians. Our experimental findings underscore the promising potential of integrating LLMs into the clinical diagnostic process for rare diseases. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to evaluate on RareBench

#### Load Data

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

datasets = ["RAMEDIS", "MME", "HMS", "LIRICAL", "PUMCH_ADM"]

for dataset in datasets:
    data = load_dataset('chenxz/RareBench', dataset, split='test')
    print(data)
```

#### API-based LLMs

```
Put your own Openai key in the llm_utils/gpt_key.txt file.
Put your own Gemini key in the llm_utils/gemini_key.txt file.
Put your own Zhipuai key in the llm_utils/glm_key.txt file.
```

#### Local LLMs

```
Replace the content in the mapping/local_llm_path.json file with the path to the LLM on your local machine.
```
